* Farlado's .emacs
** Installation and Configuration
1. Clone the repo into your home directory as ~.emacs.d~.
1. Inside the repo, choose your font size using ~make~. The options are ~bigfont~ (22), ~mediumfont~ (16), and ~smallfont~ (10). The default is ~smallfont~.
1. Make sure if you aren't going to use exwm you remove everything in the ~EXWM~ section of ~config.org~
The commands to do this should look somewhat like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/farlado/dotemacs ~/.emacs.d
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ make mediumfont
#+END_SRC
